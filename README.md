Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## Project Structure

The repository consists of two main parts:

### 1. Smart Contract

The Move contract is located at:

/move/sources/first_smart_contract.move

To use it, you need to publish this contract to the Sui blockchain.

### 2. Frontend DApp

The frontend is located in the `src` folder.  
It includes a proper README with instructions for setting up the project using **pnpm**.
